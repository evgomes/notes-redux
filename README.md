## React + Redux Example

Sample project created with intent of showing how to use the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) to handle state management in React applications.

This is the same application that I have built [here](https://github.com/evgomes/react-context-api) using the Context API, but here I use Redux as the state management solution.

### How to test

First, you have to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) in its latest stable version (LTS).

If you have Node installed, open the project directory and run the following commands, in sequence:

```
npm install
node run start
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to see the project running.
